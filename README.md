# Welcome to Unicycle Simulator!

### Controls
- Right arrow/D, Left arrow/a: Accelerate right, left
- Space: jump
- Up arrow/w: If parachute is bought, deploy chute

### Coins
Thoughout the level, collect coins (gilded juggling balls) to spend in the shop between levels.
Note on collecting coins: Failing a level (see below) results in the loss of 10 coins. **You cannot exit a level after you started until you succesfully complete it, meaning there is no limit to the amount of coins you may lose.**

### Blocks
You can pass through blocks going side to side or up, but not down.
There are several blocks with certain properties.
- Spikes: Spikes cause you to fail the level.
- Trampolines: Boing!
- Banner: Banners, or checkpoints, turn red when you touch them. If you fail a level, you go back to the last checkpoint you touched.

### Game
Win by getting enough coins to buy level 6, and then beat level 6.

### Note for teachers
There are several test lines above the game loop in main.py. These turn on purchases and unlock levels. Try out the parachute and level 6!
